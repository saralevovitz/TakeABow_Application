Take a bow

#Intro

Social networking is the use of Internet-based social media sites to stay connected with friends, family, colleagues, customers, or clients. Social networking can have a social purpose, a business purpose, or both, through sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram, among others.

There is another feature to social networks and it is called "Individual social status".
Through the social network and various parameters such as number of followers, amount of post comments to posts etc. people are nowadays ranked as more popular, more important, more successful etc. that is to say that the social status, or importance of a person in the eyes of the society, today, is considerably determined by the ranking on the social network, whether it is a net social network such as Facebook or Instagram, or a social-business network such as LinkedIn. That is, today many people determine the status of people based on their performance or their resume on social media. And this means that a person's ranking today is determined by the popularity in the media and professional degrees.

The big question that needs to be asked here, and we asked ourselves, are these the values by which it is right to rank people in the twentieth century? Isn't this ranking actually a bondage to social media and the business world? And what about people who do not excel in the media and do not have respectable degrees, do they not have the right to advance a profile in the media? Gain a following audience? To be heard and published?
And what if the person is a hospital nurse, who excels in his work and gives his soul to others, does he not deserve to be rated?
And what about the maid at the hotel who does her job with dedication and desperate for promotion?
And what about the same salesman in an electronics store, a professional, brilliant, who gives service and respect to consumers and thanks to him returns to the store again and again?

If there was a social platform that allows them to open a profile and get ratings from people who benefit from them, these dear people would receive a real rating, a rating of respect. Rating of truth. The feedback from followers and beneficiaries will raise the morale of these dear people and help them move forward, not because of popularity but because of value and giving.
With this platform, you will be able to raise the banner of values and bring to society justice and happiness and especially an opportunity for those who deserve it.

Based on this true feeling, of striving to establish a pure social media that will give people the opportunity to be ranked and popular thanks to their personal excellence, we decided to build our project called:  Take a bow

Project description

Take a bow is a new social media platform that will enable people from all kinds and sectors to be ranked according to their excellence or good service they give no matter what field they are involved in. 
The  Take a bow social media platform will allow individuals or third party people to open a profile for different individuals and commend them for praising their deeds, thus raising the ranking of profile holders and making them feel a sense of self-importance and recognition of how valued their actions are.  

Project objectives

1.	As mention in the intro, the main idea of the project is to enable any human being, regardless of their particular career or role, to receive positive recognition and feedback from the community, thanks to their personal excellence and contribution.
2.	In addition, the Take a bow social platform will create another tool for recruiters in recruiting employees in such a way that they can get real information from the general public about individuals. 

A few words from the project initiatives (Sara & Yael)

We are second year students in computer science and the Take a bow is our final project. Year 2020 was a tuff year because of the Covid-19 which put a lot of pressure on us as students far beyond other years, we feel we did not have enough time to invest in the execution of our great idea. However, since the idea of our project is so important and substantial and likely to bring about a positive change in the lives of so many people and in an entire global society, we decided that although we could not bring it to a more advanced state, we would approach it in the hope that Microsoft would see its project as a global social platform Bring the Fury as a gift to 21st century humanity.
